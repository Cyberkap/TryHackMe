# [Day 10] Insufficient Logging and Monitoring
 > - When web applications are set up, every action performed by the user should be logged. 
 > - Logging is important because in the event of an incident, the attackers actions can be traced.\
 Once their actions are traced, their risk and impact can be determined. Without logging, there would be no way to tell what actions an attacker performed if they gain access to particular web applications.
